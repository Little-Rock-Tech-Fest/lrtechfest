				h4 Frequently Asked Questions
				h5.highlight When is LRTF?
				p Thursday, October 4 - Friday, October 5, 2018
				br
				h5.highlight Where is LRTF?
				p The Statehouse Convention Center, Little Rock, Arkansas. This year's event will be hosted in the ballrooms, with vendor space outside the perimeter.
				br
				h5.highlight Who attends LRTF?
				p Little Rock Tech Fest is an annual developer conference featuring popular web, mobile and related developer topics from industry leaders, so it draws professional and aspiring software developers. Speakers from across the country come to present. Students and professionals from across Arkansas and surrounding regions come to learn and network with peers. Last year's 2017 event hosted 460 attendees. Previously, our event hosted 375 attendees in 2016. Prior to 2016 our event was a one-day free event which had 425 attendees in 2015 and 350 attendees in 2014, and 225 in 2012.
				br
				h5.highlight How can I Sponsor?
				p We accept sponsorship in the form of cash and in-kind donations. We offer benefits depending on your level of support.
				br
				h5.highlight What can you tell me about the vendor table?
				p  Some sponsors receive a vendor table, which will be set up along the perimeter of the ballroom. The tables are 6' x 30" with 2 chairs, and between each table is a 4-plug outlet.
				br
				h5.highlight What does it mean to be a room sponsor?
				p  A room sponsor typically consists of creating signage that says this room is sponsored by you and hanging 8 or so around the area.
				br
				h5.highlight What is the main topic that will be discussed?
				p  The LRTF Conference is focused on software developer topics that help keep developers educated and relevant to what’s coming out. The format of our talks will be 30 minute sessions with 10 minutes Q&A. We are also looking for CFP’s that are 1 to 1.5 hour workshops for more in depth coverage of a topic.
				br
				h6.highlight Possible Topics may include:
				ul
					li New Language Features
					li Software Development Methodologies
					li Soft-Skills for developers
					li Web Development
					li Mobile Development
					li Cloud Development
					li Database Development
					li Agile/Kanban/Scrum methodologies
					li DevOps and how it affects developers
				br
				h5.highlight As a sponsor, how many sessions can we present?
				p  This is negotiable. Typically, we're happy to accommodate our sponsors with at least one slot and we would certainly consider multiples.
				br
				h5.highlight Do you have a theme of what you are trying to present?
				p  See above. We're mostly interested in software developer focused talks - we want our attendees to leave with actionable insights they can take back to work. Our region is heavily trending toward cloud-based solutions and there is a strong interest in data analysis, machine learning, and IOT.
				br
				h5.highlight Who are the attendees? Executives? Programmers? Both?
				p  We would argue that we're about 80% developers, 10% leadership, 10% business / startup / tech enthusiasts.
				br
				h5.highlight With sponsorship, will we get a registree list?
				p  This is not something we typically provided in previous years, but we're always learning to add value for sponsors and adapt to sponsor requests.
				br
				h5.highlight What companies came last year?
				p  You can check those lists above for who sponsored in previous years. As far as attendees representation, here are several companies that were represented: Acxiom Corporation, First Orion, Information Network of Arkansas, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Arkansas Blue Cross Blue Shield, Euronet WorldWide, Elyxor, Inc, Dassault Falcon Jet, Arkansas Children's Hospital, QualChoice Health Insurance, DataPath, Inc, Lindsey Software, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, JB Hunt Transport Services, Inc., Metova, Inc., JCPenney, Praeses, to name a few.
				br
				h5.highlight Is there an opportunity to participate in a panel?
				p  Yes! We typically try to have 2-3 sessions that are panel in nature. Typically, a panel comes about because someone wants to cover a topic, but not present a formal talk and has 1-2 peers that they feel could join them to share experiences. For instance, last year, we had a DevOps panel, in which they discussed " In 'The Complete Picture' of DevOps, this set of panelists discuss how software developers, software developers in Test (SDET), and IT operations all play a role in evolving your DevOps process."
