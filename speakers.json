How is it possible to prepare teaching materials that might be outdated by the time they get released? Turns out there is a way and I am here to prove to you that the JavaScript language and ecosystem is still a safe bet. Although there are parts of the ecosystem changing all the time, there are techniques we can use to prepare for those changes without having to rewrite whole apps over and over again.\r\n\r\nBeginner & more advanced developers alike will draw value from this talk, as it will teach both of these groups how to collaborate in a productive manner when architecting and writing apps while getting ready for the unknown future."

We will talk about the trials, tribulations, and great successes of that endeavor.  We will provide an overview of our infrastructure setup, discuss the scalability and redundancy advantages that we've realized by using AWS, and then highlight some of the reason we think you should put your services in the cloud too."

        "Description": "Everything started when Brendan Eich wrote a language to run Scheme on the Netscape Navigator. Then, Ryan Dahl got the Google's V8 JavaScript runtime and developers would write JavaScript on the server side. \r\n\r\nNowadays people write JavaScript everywhere (web servers, to fly drones, tablets, mobile phones, refrigerators etc). Isomorphic JavaScript is used to describe JavaScript code that â€œcan be executed on the client and the serverâ€.\r\n\r\nReact has a powerful ability to render also on the server side. This is huge for perfomance and SEO. Also, sharing the same code between client and server makes maintenance much easier."
